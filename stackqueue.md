# Linear data structures
# Flexible with their sizes, you can add elements as you go and shrink them down
# The difference comes in how elements are removed or added to the queue


# STACK
# Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out). Like a stack of plates, the last plate put on the stack will be the first one removed
# Push = push a new item on to the stack
# Pop = removing the latest item at the top of the stack
# Peek = displaying the top element of the stack
# Length = size of how many elements are on the stack

# array has all the functions needed to operate as a stack

# QUEUE
# A queue is FIFO (First In First Out). It's like a waiting line at a movie theater. The first person in line will be the first one to go in.
